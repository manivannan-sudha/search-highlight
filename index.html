        <p id="search-txt">Protecting ecosystems is so important because they are not only crucial to our survival but also to the survival of all plants and animals on Earth. Ecosystems provide us with pure air, clean water, food, shelter, and countless other necessities. It is important to protect them because our wellbeing depends on it.  We can protect ecosystems through conservation and restoration efforts. In order to be effective, these efforts should be done on a local, federal, and global level. Examples of conservation efforts include creating wildlife sanctuaries and national parks,  having regulations on the use of natural resources, and even something as simple as recycling. </p>
